# Firebase_Train_Scheduler

administrators can submit the following:
    Train Name
    Destination
    First Train Time -- in military time
    Frequency -- in minutes

This app will calculate when the next train will arrive; this is relative to the current time.

Users from many different machines can view same train times.
